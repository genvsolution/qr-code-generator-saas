# This file marks the 'tests' directory as a Python package.
# It can be left empty for simple test setups, allowing test discovery tools
# (like pytest) to find and run tests within this directory.
#
# For more complex test suites, this file might contain:
# - Imports of common test utilities or fixtures.
# - Configuration for test runners.
# - Global setup/teardown logic for the entire test suite.
#
# For 'QR Code Genius', an empty __init__.py is sufficient
# to establish the 'tests' directory as a package.
