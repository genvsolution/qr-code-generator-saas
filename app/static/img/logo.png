I cannot generate the binary content for an image file like `logo.png` directly as text. My output is limited to text-based code and content.

To create `app/static/img/logo.png`, you would typically use a graphic design tool (like Adobe Illustrator, Figma, GIMP, or even a simple online logo maker) to design your logo and then save it as a PNG file in that location.

**Regarding the logo design, based on the project context ("QR Code Genius"):**

*   **Name:** QR Code Genius
*   **Description:** A commercial SaaS platform for generating, managing, and tracking QR codes.
*   **Aesthetics:** Simple, modern, intuitive.

A suitable logo would likely incorporate elements related to QR codes (e.g., a stylized QR pattern, a square motif, perhaps a "G" or "Q" integrated into a QR-like design) with a modern, clean font. It should be scalable and recognizable even at small sizes.

**Action Required:** Create or acquire a `logo.png` image file and place it in the `app/static/img/` directory.
