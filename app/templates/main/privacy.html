            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The security of your data is important to us. We implement robust security measures to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 ml-4 mt-3 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>HTTPS:</strong> All communications between your browser and our servers are encrypted using HTTPS.</li>
                <li><strong>Password Hashing:</strong> User passwords are never stored in plain text; they are securely hashed using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Servers:</strong> Our data is stored on secure servers with restricted access.</li>
                <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Strict server-side input validation is performed to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to user data by our personnel is strictly limited and monitored.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
